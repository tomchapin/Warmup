Warmup
======

Measures addon loading times.

The report frame automatically opens on a fresh login if not in combat.
Type `/warmup` to open the frame again later.

Scroll with the mousewheel. Hold Shift to scroll to the top or bottom. Hold Ctrl to scroll a full page up or down.

## Important:
Don't leave Warmup enabled every time you log in. The changes for GC data will have drastic effects on your performance. Warmup is a tool to aid addon development, not something to just install and forget about.
